- **Purpose:** Understands how credit limits influence **loan eligibility**.

### **15. High-Risk Client Flagging**
- **Purpose:** Identifies **clients with a high revolving balance (>90% of credit limit)**.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI** for **data visualization and dashboard creation**.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for advanced financial calculations.
- **SQL-based ETL** to preprocess raw data before Power BI analysis.

## Conclusion
